What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge is when two branches of code are merged in a non-destructive manner.
A rebase is the same as a merge except that it is destructive.Where a merge
simply points to the new feature branch, rebase changes the entire structure
of the tree, to make sure that everyhtin is on one branch.
